# How Was the Pitching Day at Ostim Technical University? e-Sanayim in the Finals!

Pitching Day, one of the most significant events at **Ostim Technical University** that fosters an entrepreneurial spirit, once again became a stage for bright ideas and excitement this year. As the **e-Sanayim** team, we proudly took our place on that stage and became **one of the top 10 finalist teams**.

## Our Project: e-Sanayim

In this era of digital transformation, one of the major problems faced by industrial companies is the difficulty in transitioning their identity and business operations to online platforms. To solve this problem, we developed a project called **e-Sanayim**.

e-Sanayim offers a **modern platform** where industrial companies can:
- Professionally showcase their corporate identity,
- Present their products and services in a digital storefront,
- Post freelance job listings,
- And increase their visibility in the digital marketplace.

## Our Team

I had the pleasure of working with an incredible team throughout this project:
- **Halit**
- **Sena**
- **Tuba**
- **Fatma**
- **Muhammed**
- **Furkan**
- **Talha**

Each of us brought different skills to the table, and this journey clearly demonstrated the power of teamwork and a shared vision.

## My Role

In this project, I took on the role of **software and design lead**. My responsibilities included:
- Designing the **user interface (UI)** of the platform,
- Creating a **demo video** to support our presentation,
- Preparing visual materials and example scenarios to highlight e-Sanayim's functionality and user-friendly approach during the final presentation.

## Our Presentation and Q&A Session

We presented e-Sanayim on the Pitching Day stage and received some truly valuable feedback from the jury. You can watch our full presentation on **Ostim Technical University's official YouTube channel**.

During the **Q&A session**, we answered questions about the platform's scalability, target audience, and technical infrastructure. This part gave us the chance to reflect on our project from multiple perspectives.

## We Became One of the Top 10 Finalist Teams

Being selected as one of the **top 10 finalist teams** at the end of Pitching Day was the reward for months of dedication and hard work. It wasn't just a win for us—it was also a great demonstration of the potential and creativity that Ostim Technical University students possess.

## Final Thoughts and Thanks

Throughout the development process of e-Sanayim, we gained a wealth of experience in both technical and communication aspects. We're truly grateful to our instructors, jury members, friends, and the entire Pitching Day organizing team for their support.

This event provided more than just a platform to present a project—it taught us the true value of generating ideas, working collaboratively, and expressing ourselves with confidence on stage.

**Looking forward to new ideas and new adventures ahead!**
