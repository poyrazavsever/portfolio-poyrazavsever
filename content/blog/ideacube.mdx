# 1st Place at Liftzone Ideacube Hackathon  
## A 30-Hour Coding Marathon That Led to Victory

A few weeks ago, my teammates **Talha**, **Halit**, and I participated in the **Liftzone Ideacube Hackathon** — an unforgettable experience where we pushed our limits and ended up winning **1st place** after nearly **30 hours of nonstop development**.

## The Idea Behind Our Project  

Our goal was to build an **AI-powered platform that connects entrepreneurs with investors**. The platform serves as a bridge where founders can pitch their ideas, and investors can discover promising projects that align with their interests and goals.

---

## Tech Stack We Used  

To bring our idea to life, we chose the following technologies:

- **Next.js** — A powerful React framework with built-in routing and performance benefits  
- **Tailwind CSS** — For fast and flexible styling  
- **Firebase** — Backend services like authentication and real-time database  
- **Gemini AI** — Integrated for content generation and smart recommendations  

---

## How We Integrated AI  

By integrating **Gemini AI**, we enhanced the platform with the following features:

- Auto-generated project descriptions based on user input  
- Smart startup suggestions for investors based on their interests  
- AI-powered matching and ranking of ideas  

This helped both entrepreneurs and investors navigate the platform efficiently.

- Delivered a polished product and a clear, impactful final presentation  

And in the end, our efforts were rewarded with **first place**.
