## Weekly Production Flow
**From fast hits to long-form depth**

Each day blends one core objective with complementary assets, ensuring that fast-moving platforms stay active while long-form projects continue to ship on time.

**Monday: Momentum Kickoff**  
_Reels: Instagram & YouTube Shorts_  
_Post + Blog: LinkedIn article and Medium blog_  
Start the week with a burst of velocity: a snackable reel for reach plus a LinkedIn post and Medium blog that turn the same idea into a long-form narrative.

**Tuesday: Visual Touchpoint**  
_Post: Instagram & LinkedIn_  
Keep conversations warm with a lighter, design-driven post; it's ideal for carousel explainers or punchy quote graphics that reinforce Monday's insights.

**Wednesday: Flagship Production**  
_Video: YouTube long-form_  
_Post: LinkedIn_  
_Cutdown: Instagram Reels & YouTube Shorts_  
The most intensive day, anchored by the hero YouTube video. Edit cutdowns for Shorts/Reels and publish a LinkedIn breakdown to spotlight the key takeaway.

**Thursday: Social Pulse**  
_Post: Instagram & LinkedIn_  
Focus on community engagement: share reactions, behind-the-scenes notes, or frameworks pulled from the Wednesday video to keep the dialogue active.

**Friday: Short-Form Energy**  
_Reels: Instagram & YouTube_  
_Post: LinkedIn_  
Ride the weekend vibe with kinetic reels plus a LinkedIn recap post that distills the week's learnings into actionable lessons.

**Saturday: Light Community Update**  
_Post: Instagram & LinkedIn_  
Deliver a softer weekend post with lifestyle photo sets, work-in-progress shots, or a short journal entry to stay consistent without heavy production.

**Sunday: Storytelling + Voice**  
_Reels: Instagram & YouTube_  
_Podcast: Spotify & YouTube_  
Wrap up with a reflective reel and a podcast episode. The audio/video format captures longer reflections, sets the tone for the upcoming week, and feeds Monday's scripts.

## Production Notes
**Guardrails that keep the system sustainable**

- Batch scripts, storyboards, and blog outlines for Monday on Friday afternoons so the week begins with execution-ready materials.
- Treat Wednesday's long-form video as the hero asset; its research and scripting feed Shorts, Reels, and even Thursday captions.
- Keep Saturday relaxed by scheduling reused snippets or photo essays captured earlier in the week.
- Use Sunday's podcast as a retrospective session to extract hooks and CTA ideas for Monday's LinkedIn copy.
