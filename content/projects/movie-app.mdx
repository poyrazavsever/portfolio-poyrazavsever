## Overview
Movie Discovery App is a React hobby project where I experiment with TMDb's API and Firebase auth to track everything I watch. Beyond browsing rich movie profiles (trailers, cast, streaming providers), I can push titles into a synced favorites list or a private watch queue, then review them on any device thanks to Firestore persistence.

## Technologies
- React + TypeScript + Vite for a fast SPA developer loop  
- TMDb REST API for metadata, posters, credits, and watch provider data  
- Firebase Authentication + Firestore for user profiles, favorites, and watchlist syncing  
- React Query to cache API responses, dedupe requests, and warm the UI for infinite scroll  
- Tailwind CSS for utility-driven layouts plus Framer Motion for card transitions  
- IndexedDB (via idb-keyval) to pin a lightweight offline watchlist snapshot

## Features
- Mood-based filters (calm, intense, nostalgic) mapped to TMDb discover queries with query param presets  
- Detailed movie drawer combining synopsis, trailers, stills, and related picks fetched lazily  
- Infinite scroll grid with skeleton loading states and optimistic favorite toggles  
- Firebase-backed favorites and watchlists that mirror into IndexedDB for offline usage

## Lessons Learned
I obsessed over API caching, race-condition handling, and skeleton states to keep interactions fluid even when TMDb rate limits or the network drops. Working through auth edge cases also sharpened how I design content calendar tools that rely on third-party APIs.
