## Features
- Mood-based filters (calm, intense, nostalgic) mapped to TMDb discover queries  
- Infinite scroll grid with skeleton loading states  
- Pinned watchlist stored in IndexedDB for offline usage

## Lessons Learned
Focused on API caching and skeleton states to keep interactions fluid even during rate-limited windows. The project later informed the content calendar visual design.
