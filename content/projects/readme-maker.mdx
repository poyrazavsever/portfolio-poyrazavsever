## Overview
README Maker is a small React side project that lets you assemble a GitHub profile README without hand-writing markdown. You pick one of several templates (minimal, badge-heavy, timeline, statistics), fill a short form for each content block, and instantly preview the final README before exporting it to your clipboard or downloading the `.md` file.

## Template System
- Template cards show live previews so you can compare layouts before selecting one.  
- Each template defines slots (bio, stacks, badges, pinned projects, GitHub stats). Form fields map to those slots so the UI guides what to fill in.  
- Markdown rendered preview updates on every keystroke and includes copy/download buttons so you can ship immediately.

## Technologies
- React with hooks for component state and live preview rendering  
- Redux Toolkit to persist template selections and form data across steps  
- React Router for multi-step flow between template gallery, editor, and export screens  
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for quickly theming each template variant  
- LocalStorage sync middleware so your answers survive refreshes

## Outcome
The tool has been shared with hackathon friends and helped dozens of students publish their first polished GitHub profiles. Because templates are simple JSON configs, I can add new layouts in minutes and the Redux store automatically supports the new slots.
