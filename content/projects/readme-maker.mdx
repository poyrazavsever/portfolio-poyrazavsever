## Problem
Hackathon teams kept shipping with empty README files. I built a UI that asks a few structured questions about the stack, core features, and deployment, then feeds them into an LLM prompt.

## Stack
- Next.js App Router with server actions  
- OpenAI API for copy generation + diffing  
- Markdown preview with syntax highlighting

## Result
In the first week more than 200 README files were generated. Teams now start mentorship sessions with a complete project overview and setup instructions.
