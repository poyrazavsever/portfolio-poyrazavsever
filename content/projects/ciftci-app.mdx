# Çiftçi App with Ottoqua

I serve as the software lead inside Ottoqua for this initiative. The goal: give farmers an AI-powered assistant that handles disease detection, logistics, and communication in one place.

## Context & Responsibilities
- Lead the Next.js codebase, design the data model, and coordinate with Ottoqua's agronomy team.
- Own the Supabase schema (auth, row-level security, realtime messaging) and Gemini integration for computer vision prompts.
- Ship weekly releases to a pilot group of 50 farmers and iterate based on their voice notes and field visits.

## Features That Matter to Farmers

### 1. Plant Disease Prediction via Photo
Farmers upload a leaf photo, we run it through Gemini Vision prompts fine-tuned with Ottoqua's dataset, and respond with:
- Likely disease and confidence score
- Immediate treatment steps (spray, irrigation change, quarantine)
- Recommended product list with dosage

### 2. Nearby Agrochemical Store Finder
Using Supabase PostGIS + open municipal data we map the nearest certified chemical shops.
- GPS pin from farmer's location
- Filter by product availability (fungicide, fertilizer, etc.)
- Directions + contact via WhatsApp deep links

### 3. Community Forum
A lightweight forum allows farmers to share best practices and ask experts for help.
- Channels by crop (wheat, tomatoes, hazelnut)
- Upvoted answers pinned by moderators
- Gemini suggests related threads before posting to cut duplicates

### 4. Messaging & Advisory Inbox
Farmers can DM Ottoqua agronomists or suppliers.
- Supabase Realtime channels with optimistic UI
- Audio note transcription using Gemini text-batching
- Automated follow-up reminders when an advisor hasn't replied within 12 hours

## Impact & Next Steps
- 50 pilot farmers actively logging disease reports, 1,200+ AI diagnoses served.
- Time to find reliable chemical supplies dropped from hours to minutes thanks to the locator.
- Community forum retains 78% of weekly active users due to helpful responses.
