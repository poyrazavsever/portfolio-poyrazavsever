## Data Sourcing
I compiled more than 250 milestones from archival books, then normalised them into a JSON schema that supports filtering by theme (education, diplomacy, military). Images are stored on Cloudinary with accessible captions.

## UX Decisions
- Timeline zoom that snaps to decades  
- Keyboard-friendly navigation so classrooms can use it on projectors  
- Print-friendly export for teachers preparing worksheets

## Impact
Teachers at Ostim Technical University cite it during history workshops, and the repo spawned several pull requests that added Ottoman Turkish translations of key speeches.
