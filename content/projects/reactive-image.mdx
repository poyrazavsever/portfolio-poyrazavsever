## Why I built it
Most portfolio sites crave motion but ship heavy video files. Reactive Image exposes a `<ReactiveImage>` component that layers gradients, noise, and cursor-aware parallax over any asset while keeping bundle size tiny.

## Features
- Theme tokens for light/dark palettes that sync to CSS variables  
- Built-in motion presets (float, tilt, spotlight) configurable via props  
- SSR friendly thanks to App Router safe checks  
- Tree-shakable build published to npm

## Adoption
The package has been installed over **5,000 times** and powers the hero on my own site plus a few agency landing pages. Feedback from the community helped prioritise TypeScript generics and reduced-motion fallbacks.
